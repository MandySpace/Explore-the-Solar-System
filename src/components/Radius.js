          radius, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things
          with mass or energyâ€”including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light
          are attracted to (or gravitate toward) one another. radius has an
          infinite range, although its effects become weaker as objects get
          farther away.
